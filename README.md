UberGame is a 3D first person shooter engine, developed as a hobby, to acquire a deeper knowledge of 3D programming. 

It can load any model using Assimp, model animations are implemented, but since there is no AI, the first animation is played repeatedly. Realtime lighting and shadows are also implemented. It allows physical interaction with player and objects.
